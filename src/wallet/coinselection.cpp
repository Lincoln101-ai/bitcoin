/*
 * This is the Branch and Bound Coin Selection algorithm designed by Murch. It searches for an input set that can pay for the
 * spending target and does not exceed the spending target by more than the cost of creating and spending a change output. The
 * algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission
 * of a UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first.
 * At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the
 * target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from
 * this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored
 * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.
 *
 * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing
 * the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long
 * term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:
 *
 * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã— (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)
 *
 * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree
 * is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test
 * equivalent combinations. This allows us to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an
 * omitted predecessor.
 *
 * The Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis: https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf

 * @param const std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool -> The set of UTXOs that we are choosing from. These UTXOs will be sorted in descending order
 *                                             by effective value and the CInputCoins' values are their effective values.
 * @param const CAmount& target_value -> This is the value that we want to select. It is the lower bound of the range.
 * @param const CAmount& cost_of_change -> This is the cost of creating and spending a change output. This plus target_value is the upper bound
 *                                  of the range.
 * @param std::set<CInputCoin>& out_set -> This is an output parameter for the set of CInputCoins that have been selected.
 * @param CAmount& value_ret -> This is an output parameter for the total value of the CInputCoins that were selected.
 * @param CAmount not_input_fees -> The fees that need to be paid for the outputs and fixed size overhead (version, locktime, marker and flag)
